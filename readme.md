# CM1100 Traffic Light Repository
A readme.md file usually tells someone looking at your repository what it contains. 
It would be good if you used it to tell me what files your have added to make your Trafic Light work ;)

Currently in this repo there are all the solutions to the labs and the code you saw in the Buttons and Buzzers lecture. I hope you can use all of these to create your own amazing traffic light.

You can upload your files simply by clicking the UPLOAD FILES button above.
